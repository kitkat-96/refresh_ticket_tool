## Running on Raspberry Pi
**Disclaimer: I do not have a Raspberry Pi and therefore am unable to test this process, or whether the code works on a Rapsberry Pi**

Notes:
* A Raspberry Pi should come preinstalled with Git and Python. 
* This code should run with Chromium, which is an open-source version of Chrome which works on the Raspberry Pi. 

Steps:
1. Open the Raspberry Pi terminal.
2. Install Chromium by running the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver
```
3. Check Chromium has been installed properly by running:
```bash
chromium-browser --version
```
4. Check that Chromium has been installed into the _/usr/lib/chromium-browser/_ folder. If it has not, move it into this folder.
5. In the terminal, move into the directory that you wish to clone the git repository into using the cd command.
6. If you would like to check what files are in your folder, or what folder you are in run the following commands:
```bash
ls
pwd
```
7. In the directory clone the git repository by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kitkat-96/refresh_ticket_tool.git
```
8. Move into the refresh_ticket_tool folder by using the following command:
```bash
cd refresh_ticket_tool
```
9. Within the refresh_ticket_tool folder, run the following commands 
```bash
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
10. Now we are ready to run the refresh script. Run the following command:

```
